			<h2>Proposed Privacy Policy</h2>
			<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				PubPub (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an open-source publishing platform run
				by the nonprofit organization Knowledge Futures, Inc. that values your privacy. In
				this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe what information we collect from you as
				a user of our Site or Service, why we collect and use it, and how you can manage and
				delete your data.
			</p>
			<h4>1.1 Definitions</h4>
			<p>
				“Personal Information” refers to (i) any information that identifies, relates to,
				describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with you, or could reasonably
				be linked, directly or indirectly, with you, and (ii) any information that is
				associated with you and thus could potentially be used to identify or reidentify
				you, including when combined with other information from or about you. For the
				avoidance of doubt, PubPub defines Personal Information broadly, and our definition
				includes “personal data” as this term is used in the EU General Data Protection
				Regulation and “personal information” as it is used in the California Consumer
				Protection Act. Personal Information does not include (i) information that has been
				aggregated, excerpted, anonymized, or otherwise deidentified to the point at which
				an individual can no longer be identified or reidentified using reasonable efforts,
				technology, and resources and (ii) contact information that is routinely made
				available in a professional capacity to facilitate business and professional
				communications, such as the information ordinarily found on a business card, website
				profile, or CV, when used solely for purposes of professional and business
				communications.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Site” refers to our website, which includes all pages within the pubpub.org host
				directory and subdomains, all pages hosted on PubPub servers regardless of domain
				(including but not limited to Journal pages).
			</p>
			<p>
				“Service” means our services available through our Site and any mobile applications
				we may provide.
			</p>
			<h4>Data Controller</h4>
			<p>
				When this Policy mentions “PubPub,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to
				PubPub. PubPub is the data controller and responsible for your information under
				this Policy. The following is our contact information:
			</p>
			<p>
				PubPub
				<br />
				℅ Knowledge Futures, Inc.
				<br />
				245 Main street
				<br />
				Floor 2<br />
				Cambridge, MA 02142
				<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				By visiting the Site, or using any of our Service, you agree that your Personal
				Information will be handled as described in this Policy. Before using the Service or
				submitting any Personal Information to us, please review this Privacy Policy
				carefully and contact us at{' '}
				<a href="mailto:privacy@pubpub.org">privacy@pubpub.org</a> if you have any
				questions. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site
				or otherwise use the Service. Your use of our Site or Service, and any dispute over
				privacy, is subject to this Policy and the relevant{' '}
				<a href="/legal/proposed-terms">Terms of Service</a>, including any applicable
				limitations on damages and provisions for the resolution of disputes.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
			<p>
				We ask for and collect information about you when you use our Site or Service. We
				collect this information directly from you, from third parties, and automatically
				through your use of our Site or Service.
			</p>
			<h4>2.1 Information we collect directly from you</h4>

			<p>
				We collect Personal Information when you register or access the Site. The Personal
				Information collected during these interactions may vary based on what you choose to
				share with us. To register, you must submit your email address to the Site and a
				password that you create for user authentication purposes. We also ask you to
				provide a first and last name, but you may use a pseudonym if you wish. We will only
				record your email address when you submit it to us as part of the user registration
				process, our newsletter signup process, or if you send us a message. We do not
				collect your age or other age-related information.
			</p>

			<h4>2.2 Information we collect automatically</h4>
			<p>
				When you visit our Site, we may automatically collect and log the following
				information about your use of our Site or Service through cookies and other
				technologies: your domain name; your browser type, device name, and operating
				system; the URLs you requested to access; the dates, methods, and the status code of
				requests; your IP address; the time, frequency, and length of time you visit our
				Site or use our Service; the number of bytes transferred; or the URLs of pages that
				referred you to the Site.
			</p>
			<h5>2.2.1 Web Server Logs</h5>

			<p>
				When you visit the Site, our web server may record some automatically collected
				information described in Section 2.2 in its server log. We use server log
				information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site by
				identifying which parts or features of our Site are most heavily used. We also use
				this information to tailor Site content to user needs and to generate aggregate
				statistical reports. Web server logs are retained on a temporary basis, during which
				time their contents are accessible to Site administrators, and then deleted
				completely from our systems. Unless required by legal process, we do not link IP
				addresses to any Personal Information. This means that user sessions will be tracked
				by IP address, but a user’s identity will remain anonymous.
			</p>

			<h5>2.2.2 Cookies and similar technologies</h5>
			<h6>2.2.2.1 Cookies</h6>

			<p>
				We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, to track information about
				your use of our Site and Service. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we store
				on your computer or mobile device. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you
				to navigate our Site and Service, while others are used to enable a faster login
				process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are
				two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They
					disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser or power off
					your computer or device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely
					identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows
					us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity,
					after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
				</li>
				<li>
					Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer or device after
					you have closed your browser or turned off your computer or device. We use
					persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user
					activity.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h6>2.2.2.2 Disabling Cookies</h6>

			<p>
				Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your
				browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most
				browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how
				to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
				cookies altogether. Separately, you may opt out of our non-essential cookies by
				following this <a href="/legal/settings">link</a>. Visitors to our Site who disable
				cookies will not be able to browse certain areas of the Site or use the Service.
			</p>
			<h6>2.2.2.3 Other Websites</h6>

			<p>
				Other websites. This Site may contain links to and embeds of other websites. The
				websites to which the Site links may also install cookies on your computer, log your
				access to their web pages, or collect user-identifying information directly from
				you, once you proceed to browse those websites. We are not responsible for the
				privacy policies of other websites to which the Site provides links. Please visit
				the relevant websites to review their privacy policies.
			</p>

			<h5>2.2.3 "Do Not Track" Signls</h5>
			<p>
				Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may,
				however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling
				cookies), but such disabling will impair use of the Site and Service.
			</p>

			<h4>2.3 Legal basis for processing of Personal Information</h4>

			<p>
				Where required by applicable law, we rely on certain legal bases for our collection
				and processing of Personal Information, including your consent, necessity to perform
				a contract, or our legitimate interest. In the case of Personal Information
				collected to contact you with information and updates about the Company, we rely on
				your consent and our legitimate interest.
			</p>
			<h4>2.4 User-generated content</h4>

			<p>
				The Site allows registered users to post content, images, multimedia presentations,
				and other scholarly works, as well as reviews, comments and other user-generated
				content in certain areas. The content you post will be available for all registered
				users to view and will identify you as the poster by the user name you have
				selected. If you do not wish to be identified as the source of content you post to
				the Site, you should select a pseudonymous user name. We create a profile page for
				each registered user. The profile pages are public-facing. By default, the profile
				page includes your user name and information about your posted content and other
				activities on the Site. You may (but do not need to) augment your profile page with
				additional information, including a picture.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not control the content added by you to our Site and Service during your use
				of our Site and Service. For example, videos you may choose to embed as a part of
				your content on our Site and Service may include third-party trackers. You are
				agreeing that you will be responsible for any such additions, inclusions, or any
				other embedded content.
			</p>
			<h4>2.5 Children’s Data</h4>

			<p>
				Our Site and Service are intended for general audiences and not for children under
				the age of 13.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are under the age of 13, you may not use our Site or Service unless we
				receive prior verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian in accordance
				with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If we discover that our
				Site or Service has collected the Personal Information of a child under the age of
				13, we will notify the child’s parent or legal guardian and we will seek verifiable
				consent for that information from the child’s parent or legal guardian in a manner
				consistent with COPPA requirements.
			</p>
			<p>
				You must be old enough to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in
				your country (depending on your country, we may allow your parent or guardian to do
				so on your behalf). If you are a resident of the European Union, you must be at
				least 16 years old to use the Site or Service, unless we receive a prior verifiable
				consent from your parent or legal guardian.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has
				submitted Personal Information to us without your prior, written consent, then you
				may alert us at privacy@pubpub.org and request that we delete that child’s Personal
				Information from our systems.
			</p>

			<h3>3. How We Use Information We Collect</h3>
			<p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
			<h4>3.1 Provide our service</h4>

				example, we may elect to conduct internal programming analytics of anonymized
				user-generated content.
			</p>
			<h4>3.3 Offer promotions</h4>

			<p>
				We use your information for marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may
				use your information, such as your email address, to send you news, promotions, or
				to otherwise contact you about information regarding the Service or information we
				think may interest you. When you submit your email address to the Site during
				registration, we will ask you whether you want to receive periodic announcements
				from the Site by email. Accepting emailed announcements is entirely optional and not
				a condition of registration, and you may change your email settings at any time to
				subscribe or unsubscribe to these mailings.
			</p>

			<h4>3.4 Fraud prevention and compliance</h4>

			<p>
				We use your information to prevent fraud, criminal activity, or misuses of our Site
				and Service, and to ensure the security of our IT systems, architecture and
				networks. We also may use your information to comply with legal obligations and
				legal process and to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of
				our affiliates, you, or other third parties.
			</p>

			<h3>4. How We Share And Disclose Your Information</h3>
			<h4>4.1 Sharing with your consent</h4>

			<p>
				Where you have provided consent, we share your information, including Personal
				Information, as described at the time of consent and only for the purpose for which
				you have provided your information to us. We will not sell, lend, or disclose to
				third parties any Personal Information collected from users, except as described in
				this Policy.
			</p>

			<h4>4.2 Affiliates</h4>
			<p>
				We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates solely for the
				purpose of providing Service to you; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure
				of your Personal Information will be maintained by such affiliates in accordance
				with this Policy.
			</p>
			<h4>4.3 Service providers</h4>
			<p>
				We may disclose the information we collect from you to third-party vendors, service
				providers, contractors, or agents who perform functions on our behalf, including,
				but not limited to, providers of hosting services, cloud services and other
				information technology services providers, email communication software and email
				newsletter services, and payment processors. Pursuant to our instructions, these
				parties may access, process or store Personal Information in the course of
				performing their duties to us. These parties will be prohibited from using or
				sharing Site user information for any purpose other than performing functions on our
				behalf.
			</p>
			<h4>4.4 In response to legal process</h4>
			<p>
				We ordinarily do not disclose to third parties Site usage by individual IP
				addresses, but we may do so without further notice to you in very limited
				circumstances when complying with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or
				other legal process, working with consultants assisting us with fixing or improving
				the Site, or monitoring and improving the security of our network.
			</p>
			<h4>4.5 To protect us and others</h4>
			<p>
				We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is
				necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
				suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person,
				violations of this Policy, of any relevant Terms of Use, or as evidence in
				litigation in which we are involved.
			</p>
			<h4>4.6 Aggregate and De-identified information</h4>
			<p>
				We may share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third parties
				and publicly for marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Please note that except as noted above, we will not sell or share your Personal
				Information with any third party for their direct marketing purposes without your
				consent.
			</p>

			<h3>5. Third-Party Analytics</h3>
			<p>
				PubPub uses Heap, a third-party analytics service. Heap collects anonymous
				information from users to help us track Site usage and referrals from other
				websites. Information collected and processed by Heap includes the user’s IP
				address, network location, and geographic location. Heap acquires all its
				information directly from the user, by installing a cookie on JavaScript-enabled
				computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use the information collected by Heap to perform Site usage analytics through
				storing, aggregating and summarizing information about user behavior on our
				platform. We do this to optimize the website experience for our visitors, to help
				our engineering team make product decisions, and to help communities who use our
				service to measure the performance of their content. If you allow us to enable Heap
				while you browse, we will send requests to Heap’s servers containing things like the
				URL of the current page, your browser version, and your IP address. If you&#x27;re
				logged in, we will also send your PubPub user ID, which is made of random letters
				and numbers.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will never send Heap any identifying information such as your name, affiliation,
				or email address.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not share with Heap or other third parties any Personal Information, and Heap
				does not collect any personal identifying information.
			</p>
			<p>For more information about Heap, please visit https://heap.io/tos/.</p>
			<h3>6. Third-Party Links</h3>

			<p>
				The Site may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us,
				including social media services (“Third Party Sites”). The information that you
				share with Third Party Sites will be governed by the specific privacy policies and
				terms of service of the Third Party Sites and not by this Policy. By providing these
				links we do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed these Third Party Sites and
				we are not responsible for the information practices of such Third Party Sites.
				Please contact the Third Party Sites directly for information on their privacy
				practices and policies.
			</p>
			<h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
			<p>
				In certain circumstances, providing Personal Information is optional. However, if
				you choose not to provide Personal Information that is needed to use some features
				of our Service, you may be unable to use those features.
			</p>
			<h4>7.1 Rights relating to my Personal Information</h4>

			<p>
				You may request access, modification, or deletion of Personal Information that you
				have submitted to us by contacting us at{' '}
				<a href="mailto:privacy@pubpub.org">privacy@pubpub.org</a>. For example, you may ask
				us to correct, update, or delete your Personal Information. We will reply to and
				honor such requests to the extent required by law. We may need to retain some
				information in order to comply with law, and to defend or exercise our legal claims.
				Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified, or deleted
				may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site for a period of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				EU residents may also request to exercise certain additional rights under the
				General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) to restrict processing (Art. 18),
				request data portability (Art. 20), and object to certain processing (Art. 21). We
				will respond to such requests in the time period and to the extent required by the
				GDPR. Such requests can be made by contacting us at{' '}
				<a href="mailto:privacy@pubpub.org">privacy@pubpub.org</a>.
			</p>

			<h4>7.2 Non-U.S. Users</h4>

			<p>
				If you use the Site or Service outside of the United States of America, you consent
				to having your Personal Information transferred to and processed in the United
				States of America, which may have less protections than your jurisdiction of
				residence.
			</p>

			<h4>
				7.3 What choices do I have regarding use of my Personal Information for marketing?
			</h4>

			<p>
				We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you if you have signed
				up for such information on the Site. You may opt-out of such communications by
				following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may
				take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of
				receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest
				you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Service you have
				requested or received from us.
			</p>

			<h4>7.4 Data retention</h4>

			<p>
				We, generally, retain Personal Information as long as necessary to fulfill the
				purposes for which the Personal Information was collected, including for as long as
				you use our Service. We may continue to retain such Personal Information even after
				you cease to use any particular Service, as reasonably necessary to comply with
				applicable laws and our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and
				abuse, enforce our agreements, and protect our legitimate interests.
			</p>

			<h3>8. Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
			<p>
				You use the Service at your own risk. We implement commercially reasonable
				technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect your Personal
				Information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
				disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, no system or electronic transmission
				is ever fully secure, impenetrable, or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or
				from us may not be secure. We cannot completely guarantee the security of our
				database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be
				intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Therefore, you should
				take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Service or
				e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to us via
				the Internet. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy
				settings or security measures contained on the Service, or third party websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information
				we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
				destruction. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can
				guarantee 100% security.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password,
				phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared
				computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and
				keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost,
				stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via
				unauthorized password activity.
			</p>
			<h3>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>
				This Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above. As we periodically
				review our security measures and Privacy Policy, the Service may change from time to
				time. As a result, we may change this Privacy Policy at any time, so please be sure
				to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Policy on the Site,
				unless another type of notice is required by the applicable law. If we make any
				changes to this Policy that materially affect our practices with regard to the
				Personal Information we have previously collected from you, we will endeavor to
				provide you with notice in advance of such change by highlighting the change on our
				Site or if you have an account with us, providing notice to the email address in
				your account (for this reason you should make sure to update your account
				information promptly if it changes). By continuing to use our Service or providing
				us with Personal Information after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy, or
				notified you by other means if applicable, you consent to the revised Privacy Policy
				and practices described in it.
			</p>
			<h3>10. Contact Us</h3>
			<p>
				If you have questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or our information
				practices, please contact us at{' '}
				<a href="mailto:privacy@pubpub.org">privacy@pubpub.org</a>. If you are an EU
				resident and believe our processing of your Personal Information violates data
				protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
				authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of
				your habitual residence, your place of work, or the place of the alleged violation.
